## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- pyproj
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:tealeave/parking-ticket-free.git
   cd parking-ticket-free
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Data Parsing and Clustering

This script parses the parking citation data, converts the coordinates from regional Lambert Conformal Conic projection to WGS 84, and clusters the data using KMeans.

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python parsing_data.py
   ```

### Neural Network Training

This script trains a neural network model (mlp) on parking citation data using PyTorch.

1. Adjust the hyperparameters in the script to point to your data and desired configurations.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python la_parking_torch.py
   ```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- pyproj
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/LA_Parking_Citation_Analysis.git
   cd LA_Parking_Citation_Analysis
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Neural Network Training

This script trains a neural network model on parking citation data using PyTorch.

1. Adjust the parameters in the script to point to your data and desired configurations.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python la_parking_torch.py
   ```

### Data Parsing and Clustering

This script parses the parking citation data, converts the coordinates from regional Lambert Conformal Conic projection to WGS 84, and clusters the data using KMeans.

1. Adjust the parameters in the script to point to your data and desired configurations.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python parsing_data.py
   ```
